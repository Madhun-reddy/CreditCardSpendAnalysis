6.**Recommendations**
- **Improve conversion rates:** The report shows that the total number of funded loans is lower than the total number of applications (38.6K applications vs $435.8M funded amount). This suggests that there may be room to improve conversion rates. Businesses could do this by streamlining the loan application process, offering more competitive rates, or providing better customer service.
- **Consider offering alternative loan products:** The report shows that the most common loan purposes are debt consolidation, credit cards, and home improvement. Businesses could consider offering alternative loan products to meet the needs of these borrowers. For example, they could offer personal loans for debt consolidation, business loans for home improvement, or credit lines for businesses that need access to working capital.
- **Invest in marketing and outreach:** With demand for loans strong, businesses may want to invest in marketing and outreach to attract new borrowers. They could target their marketing efforts to specific customer segments, such as businesses in certain industries or businesses located in certain geographic areas.
- **Develop relationships with business partners:** Businesses can partner with other businesses, such as accountants or financial advisors, to refer customers to each other. This can be a great way to reach new borrowers and grow your loan portfolio.
